# HarmanQ30
This preset is optimized for audiophiles seeking to capture every nuance of their music. It delivers a natural and balanced sound profile, providing the closest experience to the original recording. As an audiophile myself, I've meticulously fine-tuned this preset to ensure the best possible listening experience, carefully adjusting all frequencies.

This equalizer is for Soundcore Q30 and Q30 (Upgraded)

- Green is default
- Purple is HarmanQ30

### A little note
I have the Q30 (upgraded) model, and while I think it's almost identical to the regular Q30, there might be some minor differences. 

I dont recommend using AAC codec. Worse sound quality and higher power consumption.
